First year Epitech project : Lemin
This is a sort of calculation system based off of anthills.
The program must find possible paths and send ants to explore them.
A room can be connected to an infinite number of other rooms by as many tunnels as needed, but a tunnel can only connect two
rooms.
On the standard input, the program must receive the anthill description the following way: first, the number of ants, then the rooms and their position and finally the tunnels (defined by the rooms they connect). The roomsâ€™ coordinates will always be whole numbers.
